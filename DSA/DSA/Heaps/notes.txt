A heap is a special type of tree with two properties:
1 - Complete: This property indicates that every level of our tree is filled (exception made to the last level), and nodes are inserted from the left to the right.
2 - Heap property: Every value in the child nodes is equal or lower than the root node.
    - There are two types of heaps here:
        - Min heap: where the root node holds the lowest value.
        - Max heap: where the root node holds the highest value.
When implementing a heap, we use an array because we know that there are no holes, since items are inserted from left to right.
    - Due to this, we have a couple of ways of knowing the important indexes:
        - Left child: left = parent * 2 + 1
        - Right child: right = parent * 2 + 2
        - Parent (from a child node): parent = (index - 1)/2
